Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Covers the absolute basics of HTML, to get you started — we define elements, attributes, and other important terms, and show where they fit in the language. We also show how a typical HTML page is structured and how an HTML element is structured, and explain other important basic language features. Along the way, we'll play with some HTML to get you interested!</p>

  <dd>
    <p>The <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Head">head</a> of an HTML document is the part that <strong>is not</strong> displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded. It contains information such as the page <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title"><code>&lt;title&gt;</code></a>, links to <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS">CSS</a> (if you want to style your HTML content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and metadata (data about the HTML, such as who wrote it, and important keywords that describe the document).</p>

  <dd>
    <p>One of HTML's main jobs is to give text meaning (also known as <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics">semantics</a>), so that the browser knows how to display it correctly. This article looks at how to use HTML to break up a block of text into a structure of headings and paragraphs, add emphasis/importance to words, create lists, and more.</p>

  <dt id="creating_hyperlinks"><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks">Creating hyperlinks</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Hyperlinks are really important — they are what makes the web a web. This article shows the syntax required to make a link and discusses best practices for links.</p>

  <dt id="advanced_text_formatting"><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting">Advanced text formatting</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>There are many other elements in HTML for formatting text that we didn't get to in the <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals">HTML text fundamentals</a> article. The elements here are less well-known, but still useful to know about. In this article, you'll learn about marking up quotations, description lists, computer code and other related text, subscript and superscript, contact information, and more.</p>

  <dt id="document_and_website_structure"><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure">Document and website structure</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>As well as defining individual parts of your page (such as "a paragraph" or "an image"), HTML is also used to define areas of your website (such as "the header", "the navigation menu", or "the main content column"). This article looks into how to plan a basic website structure and how to write the HTML to represent this structure.</p>
