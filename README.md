**DISCLAIMER**: _This script doesn't handle correctly headings that contains
other tags. It is made to work only on plain headings that's created by a
rich text or markdown editor._

Extracts relevant table of contents data out of your HTML markup and add
permalinks to your markup's headings.

Takes your HTML markup, outputs a string in JSON format of the relevant
data (level, content and slug) and inserts permalinks to the markup's
headings.
